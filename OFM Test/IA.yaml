    # - ["2011-07", null] # A segmented well, only this segment is kept

  # Options for data processing: "producing_time" and "calendar_time"
  preprocessing: "producing_time"

  curve_fitting:
    # How to split the times series for (1) out-of-sample error reporting and
    # (2) hyperparameter tuning.
    # float -> split time series by fraction (between 0 and 1)
    # int -> split time series by time index (negative or positive)
    # date -> split time series by this date (format "YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM")
    split : 0.8

    # What kind of decline curve to use. Options: "arps" or "exponential"
    curve_model : "arps"

    # in units of input resolution, e.g., months or days
    forecast_periods : 365

  # Hyperparameters given as numbers are fixed, and those given as
  # a range [low, high] are tuned out-of-sample on test data using the split
  hyperparameters:
    half_life : [90, 720]
    prior_strength : [0.001, 1]
